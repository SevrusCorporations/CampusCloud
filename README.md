Serving all required files about a course at same place, No more asking for files in the whatsapp groups, leading to redundancy issues.
It's an **API** made by Me aka [SirSevrus](https://github.com/sevruscorporations).

## Motive of creating such API
During my college, we have been facing some issues like we had a group where the study materials and notices are sent, but as new students came, materials are requested again and again and causing same file on whatsapp group sent multiple times. So I decided to create a full webapp where files are uploaded as they're sent on whatsapp, making things to be organized and acessible at a common location instead of sending it again and again on same whatsapp group.

## Tech Stack
The Tech Stack I'm currenty decided to use are -
- **python** - For Backend API
- **Html, JS, CSS** - For Frontend UI
