# CampusCloud

CampusCloud is a lightweight **file sharing and organization platform** designed for colleges and study groups.  
It helps students and teachers keep all study materials, notices, and resources in **one central place**, removing the need to repeatedly share the same files on WhatsApp or other messaging apps.

## ✨ What CampusCloud Can Do

- 📂 **Upload Files Easily**  
  Users can upload notes, assignments, question papers, and other study resources to the platform.

- 🔍 **Organized by Subjects/Folders**  
  Files can be categorized into different subjects or folders (like *Mathematics*, *EVS*, *IT-OS* etc.), making it easy to find what you need.

- 🖥️ **Web Dashboard**  
  A simple dashboard lets you log in, view your information, and access uploaded materials without confusion.

- ⚡ **Avoid Redundancy**  
  Once uploaded, files are stored in one place so they don’t have to be re-shared multiple times in WhatsApp or Telegram groups.

- 🔒 **Authentication System**  
  Only authenticated users (students/teachers) can log in, ensuring the platform is secure and not publicly spammed.

- 📡 **API Powered**  
  The backend is built with **Python**, serving a REST API to handle authentication, uploads, and data retrieval.

- 🎨 **Modern Frontend**  
  Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for a clean, simple, and responsive interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python (Flask/FastAPI)** – Backend API  
- **HTML, CSS, JS** – Frontend UI  
- **InfiniCLOUD / WebDAV** – File storage and management  
- **SQLite/MySQL/Postgres** – (Pluggable) database for user & file metadata

## 📌 Why CampusCloud?
> During college, I noticed that the same files were being sent again and again in WhatsApp groups as new students joined. This caused **duplication and clutter**.  
> CampusCloud was built to **centralize file sharing**, so students and teachers can just upload once, and everyone can access materials at a single source.

## 🚀 Future Plans
- ✅ Search functionality for quickly finding files  
- ✅ Drag-and-drop uploads  
- ⏳ Admin dashboard for managing users and materials  
- ⏳ Mobile-friendly UI / PWA support
